Magrathea is an ancient planet in orbit around twin suns Soulianis and Rahm in the horsehead Nebula.
It was once home to a specialist industry of costum-made luxury planets; which were sold to the richest people in the universe.
The Magratheans who made the computer Earth in attempt to answer The Ultimate Question of Life the Universe and Everything.
This caused Magrathea to become so rich the rest of the universe became bankrupt and the Magratheans hibernated until their services could be afforded again.
The story of Magrathea disappeared and people began no longer believing the planet existed.
A potted flower and a sperm whale once fell from a great height and died on this planet.
